# Build a workspace app

A workspace app (called a gadget in code and in API names) is a versioned
record in one Workspace. Its manifest says what the app is; its revisions are
append-only. There are three kinds of app, chosen by the manifest `entry`:

| `entry`                         | What renders                                             |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tedix:app/<id>`                | A built-in OS app, rendered first-party with no iframe   |
| `ui://widgets/mcp-app/<slug>/…` | An MCP App widget, rendered in the sandboxed widget host |
| a skill slug (or `skillSlug`)   | A governed skill run from the app's **Runs** view        |

A built-in app keeps every tenant choice in the manifest `config`, never in
code. The OS validates `config` against the app's schema when a revision is
written, so a wrong setting fails the write with the exact path that is wrong.

## Install and configure an app

From chat or MCP, use the OS app tools in the organization's namespace
(discover the exact callable first):

1. `create_os_gadget` with `workspaceId`, `name` and an optional
   `description`. This creates the record only.
2. `revise_os_gadget` with `workspaceId`, `gadgetId` and the `manifest`
   (`entry` and `config`). Pass `expectedRevision` (0 for a new app). Each
   change of settings is a new revision; nothing is edited in place.
3. Read it back with `get_os_gadget` and give the user the app link:
   `https://<org>.tedix.dev/workspace/<workspaceId>?workpiece=gadget:<gadgetId>`.
   Add `&pane=workpiece` to open it full screen on a phone.

In the OS, the same settings are editable under the app's **Code** view
(`manifest.json`).

## Card review

`tedix:app/card-review` shows a factory's card sheets one card at a time:
who and where, why it matters (the rule that fired, in plain words), the
suggested action or draft, and the buttons **Useful**, **Not useful**,
**Do it**, **Snooze** and **Skip**. Swipe right or left on a phone; on a
keyboard use ←/→, D, S, K, the number keys for reason chips and Z to undo.

Verdicts go into the card sheet's own cells: the useful column gets `yes` or
`no`, the reason column gets the chips and note as `Chip, Chip: note`, and
the done column gets `yes` from **Do it** (`no` from **Not useful**). A
factory that already reads those cells keeps working unchanged. Snooze is
per viewer and writes nothing.

**Do it** never sends, posts or changes a mailbox. `approve` marks the done
column; the factory or the person carries the action out. `copy_and_open`
copies the draft, opens the source link and marks the done column.

Rules-sheet rows with status `proposed` appear above the cards with
**Accept** and **Reject**, which set the status to `accepted` or `rejected`.

### Example config

```json
{
	"entry": "tedix:app/card-review",
	"capabilities": [],
	"config": {
		"version": 1,
		"sources": [
			{
				"label": "Inbox",
				"workspaceId": "11111111-1111-4111-8111-111111111111",
				"cardSheetPrefix": "Inbox cards ",
				"maxRuns": 3,
				"columns": {
					"number": "#",
					"type": "Card type",
					"source": "Thread",
					"action": "Proposed action",
					"why": "Why",
					"draft": "Draft",
					"useful": "Useful?",
					"reason": "Reason",
					"done": "Approve action?"
				},
				"doIt": "approve",
				"rules": {
					"sheetTitle": "Rules",
					"idColumn": "Rule id",
					"textColumn": "Rule",
					"statusColumn": "Status"
				},
				"feedbackSheetTitle": "Feedback log",
				"reasonChips": {
					"useful": ["Good catch", "Saves time"],
					"notUseful": ["Wrong person", "Not timely", "Keep this mail"]
				}
			},
			{
				"label": "Social",
				"workspaceId": "22222222-2222-4222-8222-222222222222",
				"cardSheetPrefix": "Social cards ",
				"columns": {
					"number": "#",
					"type": "Type",
					"source": "Source",
					"who": "Who",
					"why": "Why",
					"draft": "Draft",
					"useful": "Useful?",
					"reason": "Reason",
					"done": "Did it?"
				},
				"doIt": "copy_and_open",
				"channels": [
					{ "label": "LinkedIn", "match": ["linkedin.com", "linkedin"] },
					{ "label": "X", "match": ["x.com", "twitter.com"] }
				]
			}
		]
	}
}
```

Column names match sheet headers case-insensitively, exactly or as the start
of a header, so `Thread` finds `Thread (sender · subject · Gmail link)`. One
app may read several Workspaces; the viewer must be able to open each one.

### Review cards from chat or MCP

The app holds no data of its own, so an agent reviews with the output tools:

- "Show my next card": `list_os_outputs` for the source Workspace, take the
  newest sheet whose title starts with `cardSheetPrefix`, then
  `get_os_output` and pick the first row whose useful, reason and done cells
  are all empty.
- "Mark it useful: great angle": `set_os_sheet_range` on that sheet with the
  row index as `startRow`, the useful column's index as `startColumn`, and
  `cells: [["yes", "Great angle"]]` when the reason column follows it. Pass
  the revision you read as `expectedRevision`; on a conflict, read again.

## Add another built-in app

Put the settings schema in `packages/api-contract/src/schemas/` and check it
in `OsGadgetManifestWriteSchema`, put the engine in `apps/os/src/lib/` with
unit tests, render it from `canvas-doc-panel.tsx` for its entry, and build the
screen from `@/components/kumo/*`. Read and write through the existing OS
queries and the generated `osQuery` keys.

## Traps

- Tenant choices belong in `config`. Hardcoding a workspace, sheet id or
  column in code breaks the next tenant.
- Reads stay lenient: only writes check `config`, so an old revision never
  becomes unreadable after the schema changes.
- A range write must fit the sheet's current columns. Write one rectangle
  and copy the current values of any column between the ones you change.
- Write verdicts with `expectedRevision` and retry once on a conflict; a
  factory may add a sheet or row at the same time.
- In chat, name the OS sheet (title or output id) in a write request. A
  follow-up such as "mark it useful" can be delegated without the sheet
  from the previous turn and end up searching other providers' files.
- Never claim an action happened because the done column says `yes`. It
  records a decision; the provider's own record is the proof.
